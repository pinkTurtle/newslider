# New Slider

  This is just another jquery slider that could be used as carousel too. For
  now it is in development.

## Installation

    $ component install pinkTurtle/newslider

## Implementation

  - html

    A minimal html structure is needed to make this work. You need create an
    html node which will be called from now as viewport; another node inside
    called wrapper and you will put as many html nodes as slides you want to have
    into the wrapper html node.

  - component

    You need to install this component into your file structure.
